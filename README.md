# Colour3Dprinter_CNC
It can either create full coloured 3D models or create PCB's. 
We used a Beaglebone Black running Ubuntu 16.04 as our microcontroller. The software was written by us mainly in C++, HTML and PHP.
The website shown acts as a front-end UI to send commands to the printer.
The body was made from scratch at our college, DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai. 
The printer uses a 3 input Diamond Hotend for colour prints. A 200W spindle motor is used to make PCB from the input data given by a .GERBER file. Actuation along the X,Y and Z axis is done with the help of NEMA-23 Stepper motors.  

We would like to thank our project guide, Dr. Prasad Joshi for all his help and guidance.
